# Brain-Tumour-Classification
Classifying brain tumours using transfer-learning. Used ResNet model to detect and diagnose 3 different types of tumours (glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, and pituitary tumor). Model trained at over 99% accuracy and developed a widget within Jupyter notebook to detect these tumours. Created model using tensorflow, check live demo:
